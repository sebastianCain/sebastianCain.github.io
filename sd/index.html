      <h1>iOS Swift Concepts and Syntax: A Primer</h1>
      <p>Hello Internet! This tutorial is not necessarily to provide a complete or fully informative idea of Swift, but just to demo some of its cool features that attract many to iOS programming.</p>
      <h3>Arrays and Loops</h3>
      <p>This should seem pretty similar to most. A lot of Swift's syntactic beauty is inspired by Python, as you can see below with an example declaration, array, and loop.</p>
      <pre>
let names: [String] = ["Anna", "Alex", "Brian", "Jack"]
for name in names {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}
      </pre>
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>Functions in Swift are basic but very powerful. Parameters can be named or unnamed, but the types of both arguments and the return value is explicit.</p>
      <pre>
func add(array: [Int]) -> Int {
    var total = 0
    for value in array {
        total += value
    }
    return total
}
print("total is \(add(array: [8, -6, 2, 109, 3, 71]))")
      </pre>
      <p>This is an example of a more complex function. It takes an array and returns a tuple.</p> 
      <pre>
func minMax(array: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int64) {
    var currentMin = array[0]
    var currentMax = array[0]
    for value in array {
        if value < currentMin {
            currentMin = value
        } else if value > currentMax {
            currentMax = value
        }
    }
    return (currentMin, Int64(currentMax))
}

let bounds = minMax(array: [8, -6, 2, 109, 3, 71])
print("min is \(bounds.min) and max is \(bounds.max)")
      </pre>
      <h3>Closures</h3>
      <p>An example of a closure in Swift is a nested function. As you can see below, a function is defined within the outer function, and then then outer function returns the inner function.</p>
      <pre>
func makeIncrementer(forIncrement amount: Int) -> () -> Int {
    var runningTotal = 0
    func incrementer() -> Int {
        runningTotal += amount
        return runningTotal
    }
    return incrementer
}

let incrementByTen = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 10)
print(incrementByTen())
print(incrementByTen())
print(incrementByTen())
      </pre>

      <h3>Enumerations and Switches</h3>
      <p>Enumerations are a really cool function of Swift that allows you to quickly define a type with uncommon values, that shouldn't just be represented as a string/integer/other common data type. A switch is just a fancy form of an if statement, but it works especially well with enumerations. Because the data type is already known in the first line of the switch statement, it is unnecessary to precede the property with the enum name.</p>
      <pre>
enum Compass {
    case north
    case south
    case east
    case west
}

let direction = Compass.east

switch direction {
case .north:
    print("Canada bound")
case .south:
    print("Mexico bound")
default:
    print("Still in the US")
}
      </pre>

      <h3>Structs, Classes, and Optionals</h3>
      <p>Structs and Classes are common types to store large amounts of information in, and they are easily declared and used in Swift. The declaration takes only line. Structs and classes can contain properties, functions, enums, closures, pretty much anything. However, structs in swift are pass-by-value (and classes are not), so for predictably large objects a class is recommended. </p>
      <pre>
struct Resolution {
    var width = 0
    var height = 0
}

class VideoMode {
    var resolution = Resolution()
    var interlaced = false
    var frameRate = 0.0
    var name: String? {
        didSet {
            print("yay")
        }
    }
    
    enum Status {
        case Running
        case Paused
        case Inactive
    }
    
    func checkStatus() -> Status {
        if self.frameRate != 0.0 {
            return .Running
        } else {
            return .Paused
        }
    }
}

let vm = VideoMode()
vm.resolution = Resolution()
vm.name = "Broski"
vm.checkStatus()
      </pre>

      <h3>Optionals</h3>
      <p>Any type in Swift can be declared as an optional. This means that the value can be nil at any given time, and the programmer must account for that by checking its value by doing operations on it. This nil ability is great for programmers who want to distinguish between lack of any value and presence of a default value, like 0 or "". Unwrapping an optional can be done with an if let statement, demonstrated below.</p>
      <pre>
var str: String?
str
//str = "gottem"
type(of: str)
str
if let s = str {
    type(of: s)
} else {
    print("lmao")
}
      </pre>

      <h3>Generics</h3>
      <p>Generics are a great way to declare a universal function that can be applied to any type, such as the swap function found below. Also demonstrated is the inout functionality of Swift, which forces the variable to be pass-by-reference and therefore modify the variable passed in the argument.</p> 
      <pre>
func swapTwoValues&lt;T&gt;(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}

var someInt = 3
var anotherInt = 107
swapTwoValues(&someInt, &anotherInt)

var someString = "hello"
var anotherString = "world"
swapTwoValues(&someString, &anotherString)
      </pre>
      <p>Thanks for checking out my Swift demo. I'd encourage anyone to follow up on this by taking an indroductory course in iOS Development online.</p>
